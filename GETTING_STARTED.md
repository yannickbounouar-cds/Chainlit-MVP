./deploy-aws.sh
```

### Run with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## 🔧 What You Can Do Next

### 1. Test Your App
- Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
- Try chatting with the AI assistant
- Test different conversation flows

### 2. Customize the App
- Edit `app.py` to add new features
- Modify the system prompt in the `main()` function
- Add new conversation handlers

### 3. Deploy to Production
- Update your `.env` file with production values
- Run `./deploy-aws.sh` to deploy to AWS App Runner
- Monitor your deployment in the AWS Console

## 📂 Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Main Chainlit application with Azure OpenAI |
| `.env` | Your environment variables (keep private!) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `deploy-aws.sh` | AWS App Runner deployment script |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local Docker development |
| `health_check.py` | Health check and diagnostics |
| `run-local.sh` | Local development setup script |

## 🔐 Security Reminders

- ✅ Your `.env` file is gitignored (contains your API key)
- ✅ Use AWS Secrets Manager for production secrets
- ✅ Never commit API keys to version control

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start?
```bash
# Check health
python health_check.py

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check logs
chainlit run app.py --debug
```

### Azure OpenAI Not Working?
- Verify your API key in `.env`
- Check your endpoint URL
- Test with a simple request

### AWS Deployment Issues?
- Ensure AWS CLI is configured: `aws configure`
- Check your AWS permissions
- Verify Docker is running

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - Try your app at http://localhost:8000
2. **Customize** - Edit the conversation flow in `app.py`
4. **Deploy** - Use `./deploy-aws.sh` for production
